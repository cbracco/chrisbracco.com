Currently I work as an engineering manager for Muck Rack, a large-scale CRM and SaaS platform that helps PR agencies and journalists hone in on the stories that matter most to them.

I manage front-end engineers across several teams and collaborate with the design, product, and engineering departments to help craft and guide consistently great user experiences across the platform.
