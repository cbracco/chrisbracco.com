_Jotted these down after watching [(Coffee Club) Episode 7: Take your Tech Career to the Next Level with Networking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbQeo6Zob_M)_.

* Networking is every interaction you have
* Focus on relationships first
* Begin with a simple question, a small ask or inquisition
* Making little deposits all the time add up to something bigger
* More about giving than taking
* A personal newsletter is a form of networking
* Who knows that “you know what you know”?
* Build relationships and skillsets before you need them
* Ask exactly the question you need the answer to, and let them decide how to answer
* Reach people on the platforms they like to use
* Follow up with advice givers after you’ve tried the advice
* Following up means you are now building a relationship
* Person first, resource second
