If you can get past the incessant jargon, there are a lot of really interesting insights and real-world examples offered in _Crossing the Chasm_. The author identifies many common patterns and pitfalls of high-tech companies, and walks the reader through strategies for successful growth and market domination.

The concept of the “chasm” is easy enough to comprehend. Where I struggled to follow along was in some of the “how”. There are a lot of situational “if this, then that” and “definitely don’t do this, but you must do that” recommendations. This can make some chapters a bit tough to absorb and require several re-reads.

This book was a slog for me, but ultimately a worthwhile one.
