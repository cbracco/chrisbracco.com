Core values that our family strives to uphold. We are not perfect, but having them written down somewhere means we can revisit them periodically to remind ourselves and reflect on how weâ€™re doing.

- Live below your means
- Pause before you speak
- Control the temper
- Control the hands
- If there is a problem, talk about it
- Be honest but not hurtful
