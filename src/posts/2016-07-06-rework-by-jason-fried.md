_Rework_ is a collection of bold statements and fierce insights that touch many aspects of running a modern business. Denouncing rigidity for flexibility, caution for trust, growth for sustainability, and reservedness for honesty, Jason Fried attempts to shock us out of the 80’s “growth or bust” mindset that still consumes the minds of many founders and entrepreneurs.

The chapters are broken up into small, digestible sections on various aspects of business. I particularly enjoy and agree with the importance of writing and teaching your craft as cornerstones to building a successful business.
