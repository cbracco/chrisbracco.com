Growing up I was often skeptical of old adages like “an apple a day keeps the doctor away”, and the variety of food I allowed into my mouth was limited. As I became older my interests in eating healthier and tastier foods increased, and I found myself wondering about the composition of foods and how to better optimize my diet.

_<i>_Eating on the Wild Side_ is a treasure trove of information about the health benefits of the many varieties of fruits and vegetables available to us modern day consumers. This book goes deeper than the old adages and reveals that not all fruits and vegetables are created equal. It emphasizes that throughout history, our obsession with taming and enhancing the flavors of wild fruits and vegetables has come with the accidental cost of decreasing their nutritional value.

Despite this fact, there are still many varieties of fruits and vegetables available in our supermarkets that have great health benefits, and knowing which varieties to choose is integral. Jo Robinson also provides detailed information on how to identify quality produce, explains how to properly store your food after you bring it home, and demonstrates the best ways to cook produce to maximize its nutritional content. She even shares a few of her favorite recipes that use these methods.

This is an incredible guidebook on produce. I first purchased the electronic version, but I plan to purchase a physical copy so I can notate it and place it on my kitchen counter to use as a reference guide. If you are interested in eating healthy and upping your cooking skills, this book is a total game-changer.
