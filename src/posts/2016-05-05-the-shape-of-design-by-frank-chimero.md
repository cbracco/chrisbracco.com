Frank Chimero is one of my favorite designers, and _The Shape of Design_ is a wonderful, introspective little book about how we shape our world with design. Every line reads like a pull-quote as Frank weaves together the pillars of design with elements of the human experience. The book itself is beautifully designed&mdash;it resonates and delights while also providing great utility.
