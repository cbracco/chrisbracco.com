_Small Great Things_ took my breath away. It is one of the best novels you will ever read. It is the book that every white person who proclaims “but I don’t see color” must leave open on their nightstand. This novel taps into every human emotion and will deepen your perspective with each turn of the page.

I can’t recommend this book enough. Please read it. This is the one, folks.
