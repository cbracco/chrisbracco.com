_An Elegant Puzzle_ is a field guide for engineers who have taken the leap into management and are navigating through the complexities abound. This book is packed with concrete strategies, examples and resources pulled from Will Larson’s prolific blog and elsewhere. As someone new to the pursuit, reading this book has my brain buzzing and excited with ideas to try out with my team to help us stay happy, purposeful, motivated, and productive.

It’s already helped me work through some challenging situations and provides useful frames of reference for fuzzy areas like hiring, career paths and growth, performance reviews, and more. The recommended reading section has helped me build out an informal curriculum for myself so I can continue learning and tailoring my management skills for years to come. It’s one of the few physical books I am most glad to have on my shelf. Thanks Will!
