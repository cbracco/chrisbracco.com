Though a bit outdated, this book is full of excellent case studies, statistics, and philosophies that preach the importance of frugality in accumulating wealth. I was pleasantly surprised with the deep focus and attention this book gives to family dynamics in relation to money, wealth building, and wealth transfer. There is a lot of practical advice in this book about how to accumulate wealth, avoid the temptations of overconsumption, and how to talk about money around your family members.
