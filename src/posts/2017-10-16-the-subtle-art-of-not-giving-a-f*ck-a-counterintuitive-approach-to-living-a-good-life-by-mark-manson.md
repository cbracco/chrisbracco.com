Self-proclaimed “star” life advice blogger Mark Manson guns through tough topic after topic, addressing how to work through them with his counter-intuitive approach of “not giving a fuck” (which doesn’t mean what you think it means). The book, while sectioned off by topics, feels like one giant rant which turned me off at times. There were, however, some excellent quotes throughout the book that I am happy to have read.

I agree with a lot of Mark’s ideas about how to move through life and pursue happiness, but I found it hard to get past the overall tone and some of his crude remarks. Having already read some of Mark’s material, this book feels like a string of past blog posts repurposed and tied together by this “choose your fucks wisely” theme.
