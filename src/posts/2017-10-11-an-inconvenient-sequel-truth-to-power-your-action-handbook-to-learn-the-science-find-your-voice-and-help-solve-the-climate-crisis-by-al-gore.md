_An Inconvenient Sequel_ is the kick in the pants we all need, part deux. Not only does it remind and reinforce the perils of climate change, it provides actionable advice for those who are interested in getting involved in the cause at any level. Really, it should be everyone.

From home composting to eating less red meat to organizing a boycott, there is _at least_ one action in this book that you can take to help reverse the effects of global warming. We must come to terms with reality and align our modes of thinking around this issue, or future generations will suffer at the hands of the monster that is our indifference.
