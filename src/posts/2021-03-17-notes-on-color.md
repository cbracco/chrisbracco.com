- Color does not exist in the absence of eyeballs or brains.
- Color can evoke emotion and remind us of past experiences.
- Color is transitory.
- When selecting colors, context is key. Do research.
- Consider the cultural impact of color.
- Light source affects our perception of color.
- Contrast or harmony?
- Neutrals in a palette create spaces for the eyes to “rest”.
- Colors in proximity can affect one another. This is called simultaneous contrast.^[Which is a subset of the broader “[Contrast effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contrast_effect#Simultaneous_contrast)” topic.]
