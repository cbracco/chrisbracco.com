This novel is so captivating and visceral, yet at the same time so imprisoning and despondent. Hanya Yanagihara brings beauty and meaning to what on the surface seems regular and mundane. She drops the reader down into the shoes of a truly depressed and suicidal soul and you must hobble around in them for hours and hours. This is a deeply humanizing and emotive novel, I’ve yet to read anything quite like it. It’s one of those stories you dread to pick up, but once you do you cannot seem to put it down. It’s a difficult read, but a worthwhile one.
