Already an avid listener and fan of the _Freakonomics_ podcast, I finally got around to reading the book, and it does not disappoint. Though without a unifying theory or thesis per say, each chapter explores a set of interesting questions and makes startling connections between seemingly unrelated topics. These conclusions are often based on good data and data analysis techniques, stressing the important difference between correlation and causation.

Having just so happened to read the chapter exploring crime and gun control in the wake of the deadliest mass shooting in United States history, it delivers a stinging, poignant, and emotional reminder of the U.S. Congressâ€™s continued decision as of late to do nothing to help prevent future tragedies like these from unfolding. Perhaps mailing a copy of this book to your Congresswoman or man can help spur the progress this nation so desperately needs.
