A collection of cliche, quippy, and contradictory statements about how to live life, presented in a tongue-in-cheek sequential summary format. It’s like reading the last page of twenty seven different self-help books all at once.

It’s a fun little book to read through once, collect your favorite quips, and revisit them periodically.
