Some kids make sense of the world around them by disassembling it^[I was reminded of this notion after reading an op-ed in The New York Times entitled “[My 4-Year-Old Is a Destroyer](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/03/parenting/4-year-old-destroy-play.html)”. Thanks, Jessica.]. To a stressed parent this can appear like mindless destruction, but if you pause and look again it could be them learning.

Most parents learn to become comfortable with varying levels of chaos, but also set limits on what is and is not acceptable. Humor helps. A deep breath and a chuckle can go a long way. Try to communicate your limits consistently, and your children should feel they have enough freedom to play, disassemble, have fun, and learn.
