Currently I work as a software engineer for Muck Rack, a responsive web application built with Django and Vue.js that helps connect journalists, publications, and PR folks. I collaborate with the design, product, and engineering teams to plan and implement new application features using UX best practices, as well as handle routine maintenance, refactoring, and bug fixes.
