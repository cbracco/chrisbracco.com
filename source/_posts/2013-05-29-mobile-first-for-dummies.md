“[Mobile first](http://www.lukew.com/resources/mobile_first.asp)”, a phrase coined by Luke Wroblewski [in 2009](http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?933), is a strategy for web development that focuses on building the mobile experience of a web application first, and [progressively enhancing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_enhancement) the application for users with larger devices, better browsers, and greater bandwidth.

The idea is that if you design for the smallest devices (and least capable browsers) first, it forces you to prioritize and determine what are the most important data and actions in your application. The end result is an application that is focused on the key tasks a user is supposed to complete, without the extraneous content and interface fluff that plagues many applications that take a top-down, “PC first” approach.
