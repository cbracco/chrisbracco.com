I am a long-time <abbr title="Really Simple Syndication">RSS</abbr> feed user. I started using them back in 2006 when I was a wee freshman in college, and I like following many publications from one convenient place. Feed readers are great services. Google Reader ([R.I.P.](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/03/a-second-spring-of-cleaning.html)) was my companion for many years, but I suddenly find myself resenting the RSS experience.

## It usually goes something like this…

I discover a new blog, website, or publication that has great content and is also relevant to my interests. I’ll visit said blog and skim through some content. If I like what I see then I will usually consume some content in full, maybe leave a comment, maybe share something, and then subscribe to the RSS feed.

If the website publishes content sporadically (weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, etc), I can *usually* keep up. If they are posting multiple articles everyday, I end up having to skim through them in my feed reader, leaving several articles unread.

Since Google Reader has an inbox-style interface, the unread articles are **bold** and the ones I’ve already read are <small style="color: #646464;">less emphasized</small>. As unread articles accumulate, I become more overwhelmed and disheartened. It feels like I’ve failed that publication and myself because I couldn’t keep up. Time to give in and press the ”Mark as read“ button, or delete the feed entirely.

## A vicious cycle

I’ll keep subscribing to more feeds, assuring myself that I will find the time to keep up. After a while, the content piles up and becomes unmanageable. **This happens to me every six months or so.** And if I subscribe to a few large sites that post upwards of 50 articles per day? Forget about it, I’ve totally hosed myself after a few months. Time to delete everything and start over.

After allowing this cyclical behavior to happen for years, I came to the initial conclusion that I hated RSS. However, while writing this article I realized that:

## The problem isn’t RSS. The problem is me.

I’ve been abusing RSS all this time and didn’t even know it.

The inbox-style interfaces of many feed readers get very cluttered when the user is following frequently updated websites. If you’ve subscribed to a website like [Mashable](http://mashable.com) or [Buzzfeed](http://buzzfeed.com), your reader will soon resemble an e-mail inbox gone awry. The smaller publications you’ve subscribed to will be very difficult to find unless you filter down to those feeds, specifically.

This excerpt from Marco Arment’s article ["The power of the RSS reader"](http://www.marco.org/2013/03/26/power-of-rss) sums up my feelings nicely:

> I don’t mind missing a random *New York Times* post, but I’ll regret missing the only *Dan’s Data* post this month because it was buried under everyone’s basketball tweets and nobody else I follow will link to it later.

> The true power of the RSS inbox is keeping you informed of new posts that you probably won’t see linked elsewhere…

## So, what now?

I erased all the feeds in my Google Reader account since I heard the news that [they will be shutting down in the summer](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/03/a-second-spring-of-cleaning.html), and I uninstalled the Reeder app for iOS.

Recently, I’ve found myself browsing Layervault’s [Designer News](https://news.layervault.com) and Y Combinator’s [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) aggregators whenever I need a short break between working. For any other general news, I check [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cbracco) and [Reddit](http://reddit.com), and for personal stuff I’ll log onto [Facebook](http://facebook.com) & [Instagram](http://instagram.com) once a day (I’ve deleted the Facebook app from my phone to minimize distractions).

Until a new subscription alternative emerges that I can really get on board with, this will do just fine for now.
