title: Bye Bye, Shared Hosting
teaser: After venting my frustrations and working through a mean inferiority complex, I abandoned my comfortable WordPress shared hosting bubble and went rogue.

On the final day of 2012 I decided to cancel my shared hosting plan, move my domains to [Namecheap]({{ site.referralUrls.namecheap }}), and delete my entire website. I wanted to try my hand at configuring a <abbr title="Virtual Private Server">VPS</abbr> server from scratch. I settled on a <del>Linode 512</del> [Linode 1024]({{ site.referralUrls.linode }}) build for its affordability and great reputation.

Though primarily a front-end guy, I had *some idea* of what I was getting into. When I was a freshman in high school I configured an old Linux box in my dad’s office to run a Counterstrike server.

Our server actually became the most popular in the area. The local cyber gaming cafe got super mad, but that’s a story for another day.

After several sleepless nights and weeks of procrastination, I finally ended up with a successful configuration. Many monsters were encountered along the way, but they have since been vanquished.

While I dig [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) (the <abbr title="Content Management System">CMS</abbr> I was previously using) and I feel comfortable messing around in <abbr title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr>, I wanted a simpler solution and an excuse to play with some new toys. [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) seemed like a great alternative.

My plan was to strip this website down to its bare minimum (a weblog and an info page), launch it, and then iterate on it gradually. I will definitely be adding a work section sometime in the future, and I’d also like to have an area for some fun experiments.

## Upcoming tutorials

I have been keeping detailed notes throughout the entire process, and I intend on publishing a few tutorials on how I configured my VPS and rebuilt this website.

[Grab the RSS feed]({{ site.feedburner.url }}) and come along for the ride.
