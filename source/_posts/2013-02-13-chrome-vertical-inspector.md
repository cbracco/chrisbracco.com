When I’m in the zone and building a responsive app, sometimes I don’t want to break my streak by having to power up another device, set up the proxy, etc etc. If I am just checking the layout, this little Google Chrome trick works in a pinch. Obviously you should still check your app on real devices early and often, but I often find myself waiting until I reach a good stopping point to do so.

By default, Google Chrome won’t let you resize the browser below <del>400px</del> <ins>320px</ins> in width, which is super annoying, but there is a way around it.

Chances are if you develop in Chrome you’ve got the inspector open most of the time. I noticed that if you switch the inspector to sit vertically in the browser viewport, you can resize it to shrink the viewport below <del>400px</del> <ins>320px</ins> in width.

## How?

It’s simple. Press <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>I</kbd> (or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>I</kbd> in Windows) to open the inspector, click and hold the button on the bottom left to switch the view to vertical, and resize to taste. The short GIF above visualizes the steps.

## Bonus

If you are using Google Chrome to develop sites, I find the [Window Resizer extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/window-resizer/kkelicaakdanhinjdeammmilcgefonfh) really useful for quick viewport resizing to some common resolutions. You can also create and save your own presets. Nifty stuff.
