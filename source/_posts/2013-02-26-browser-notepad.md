Sometimes you just need to write something down momentarily to make sense of an idea, or to blow off some steam, or whatever. Why not use your browser? It’s one of the few apps I keep open.

I saw Jose’s [brilliant little idea](https://coderwall.com/p/lhsrcq) the other day and took a minute to make [my own](https://gist.github.com/cbracco/4670375).

Simply copy and paste this line of code into your browser’s address bar and be presented with a distraction-free, in-browser notepad. Bookmark it for a single-click notepad!

```html
data:text/html, <body contenteditable style="background-color: #f8f3e8; font-family: Garamond, Georgia, serif; font-size: 1.333rem; line-height: 1.5; max-width: 36rem; margin: 0 auto; padding: 3rem 1.5rem;">
```
