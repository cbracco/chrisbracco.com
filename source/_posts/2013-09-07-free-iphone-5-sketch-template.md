I’ve been playing around with [Bohemian Coding’s Sketch](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/) application lately, and I find it to be a bit more intuitive than Adobe Illustrator in some ways. It’s sort of like Keynote in that it gets out of your way, and lets you design something with minimal distractions.

As an exercise for myself I whipped up a simple iPhone 5 template that can be used to showcase an app design, or a website screenshot, or whatever.

I’m placing it here for anyone to download, for free. Go nuts!
