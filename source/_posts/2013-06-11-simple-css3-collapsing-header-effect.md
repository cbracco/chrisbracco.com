teaser: Create the illusion that the header collapses as the user scrolls down the page.

I wanted a non-JavaScript solution to make a full-width header image appear as though it was collapsing, with content below traveling above the image as the user scrolls. This is what I came up with after a few minutes of tweaking.

<div class="codepen">
  <div data-height="450" data-theme-id="23593" data-slug-hash="corFl" data-default-tab="result" data-user="cbracco" data-embed-version="1" class="codepen"></div>
  <script async src="//assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>
</div>
