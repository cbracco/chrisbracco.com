<p class="heading-4">Hello! My name is Chris and I am a web designer and developer who cares about user-centered design, performance, and accessibility.</p>

<p>Eighteen months after birth I was booting up MS-DOS to play <a href="https://archive.org/details/msdos_Reader_Rabbit_1989" rel="nofollow">Reader Rabbit</a>, and my first website went live on Angelfire when I was twelve years old. It was love at first keypress.</p>

<p>Currently I work as a front-end web developer for <a href="https://muckrack.com">Muck Rack</a>, a web application that helps connect journalists, publications, and PR folks. I am grateful for the opportunity to work with wonderful people, and help build something that gets used everyday.</p>

<p>When Iâ€™m not working, you can find me <a href="{{ site.instagram.url }}" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">spending time</a> with friends and family, <a href="{{ site.runkeeper.url }}" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">exercising</a>, reading <a href="{{ site.goodreads.url }}" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">books</a> and <a href="{{ site.readingam.url }}" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">articles</a>, listening to <a href="{{ site.lastfm.url }}" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">music</a>, contributing to <a href="{{ site.github.url }}" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">open-source software</a>, and <a href="{{ site.twitter.url }}" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">feeling feels</a>. I also go through fits and starts of <a href="{{ site.url }}/">writing</a>, <a href="{{ site.speakerdeck.url }}" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">speaking</a>, and <a href="{{ site.ello.url }}" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">taking photographs</a>.</p>
